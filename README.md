AAI-520-FinalProject

In this project, we aimed to fine-tune GPT-2 using the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus. We began by conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and remove unnecessary data. Afterward, we preprocessed the data by cleaning the text, translating non-English entries into English, and augmenting the dataset with additional dialogues. We trained our model three different times, with the final run lasting 31 epochs. Finally, we evaluated the model on various performance metrics. While our final model exhibited some quirks, such as occasional repetition, it proved effective in generating responses that convincingly mimic movie dialogue.
